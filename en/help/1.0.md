# Help for Mu 1.0

You have three options for finding help about this version of Mu:

1. The [tutorials](/en/tutorials) introduce you to using Mu. 
  They are the best place to start. The tutorial entitled
  "[Start Here!](/en/tutorials/1.0/start)" gives you the basics needed to get
  going. If you follow the tutorials, one after the other, you'll very quickly
  become an expert in using Mu (the tutorials themselves are *very easy* to
  follow).
2. The [how-to guides](/en/howto/) deal with common tasks or problems in a
  simple step-by-step manner. If you're looking for something specific then
  look here.
3. The [discussion channel](/en/discuss) is a web based chat-room for members
  of the Mu community. We expect participants to follow the Python Software
  foundation's [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
  The discussion channel is where you can ask questions or discuss Mu with
  both other users and the developers of Mu.

Finally, if you think you've found a bug in Mu then [follow the steps outlined here](/en/howto/bugs).
