Installing Mu on macOS is super easy.

<div class="panel panel-warning">
    <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!</h3></div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    <p>Mu is in the closing stages of a final 1.0 release. As a result it is
    still considered BETA software and this reflects how the installer
    currently works.</p> 
    
    <p>Put simply, we currently don't sign the installer so
    OSX complains about Mu coming from an unknown publisher. When the Mu
    1.0 is finally we won't have this issue.</p>

    <p>We've outlined the extra steps needed to help OSX start Mu for the first
    time (you'll never have to repeat this step unless you re-install another
    beta version of Mu).</p>

    <p>Hold down the "ctrl" key, click the Mu icon</strong> to display the menu shown below:</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/osx_beta1.png" alt="CTRL-click" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>

    <p>Click "Open".</p>

    <p>OSX will "verify" Mu.</p>

    <p>To launch Mu click "Open".</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/osx_beta3.png" alt="Click Open" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>
    <p><strong>This can take some time as OSX checks the Mu package, but you'll only ever have to do them once.</strong></p>
    </div>
</div>

+ Next time you launch Mu you will be able to just double click the Mu icon.
