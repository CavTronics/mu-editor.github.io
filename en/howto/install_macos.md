# How to install Mu on Mac OSX with the Official Installer 

Since most of our users will be beginners we've made it extraordinarily easy to
install Mu on Apple's Macintosh line of computers that run OSX. Mu should run
on any machine running OSX version 10.10 Yosemite or later.

First, follow the
[advice on Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260) to check
you're using a version of OSX that'll work with Mu (remember, it needs to be
a version later than 10.10).

Next, [download the installer for Mac OSX](/en/download). 
The installer itself is a disk image (a file that ends in .dmg) that you open
by double clicking it. When you open the disk image your computer will check
it is uncorrupted (this may take a couple of minutes).

Once the disk image is open, follow the steps illustrated below to install Mu.
