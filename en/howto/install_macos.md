# How to install Mu on Mac OSX with the Official Installer 

Since most of our users will be beginners we've made it extraordinarily easy to
install Mu on Apple's Macintosh line of computers that run OSX. Mu should run
on any machine running OSX version 10.10 Yosemite or later.

First, follow the
[advice on Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260) to check
you're using a version of OSX that'll work with Mu (remember, it needs to be
a version later than 10.10).

Next, [download the installer for Mac OSX](/en/download). 
The installer itself is a disk image (a file that ends in .dmg) that you open
by double clicking it. When you open the disk image your computer will check
it is uncorrupted (this may take a couple of minutes).

Once the disk image is open, follow the steps illustrated below to install Mu.

<div class="row">
  <h2>Step 3</h2>
  <p>Open the Applications folder on your Mac (where all your other
  applications are found) and double click the Mu icon to launch the
  editor.</p>

</div>

<div class="panel panel-warning">
    <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!</h3></div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    <p>Mu is in the closing stages of a final 1.0 release. As a result it is
    still considered BETA software and this reflects how the installer
    currently works. Put simply, we currently don't sign the installer so
    OSX complains about Mu coming from an unknown publisher. When the Mu
    1.0 is finally we won't have this issue.</p>

    <p>We've outlined the extra steps needed to help OSX start Mu for the first
    time (you'll never have to repeat this step unless you re-install another
    beta version of Mu).</p>

    <p>Once Mu is installed, as per the steps above, open the "Applications"
    folder, find the "mu-editor" icon then <strong>while holding down the
    "ctrl" key, click the icon</strong> to display the menu shown below:</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/osx_beta1.png" alt="CTRL-click" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>

    <p>Click the "open" item on the menu.</p>

    <p>At this point, OSX will "verify" Mu, as shown below:</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/osx_beta2.png" alt="Verify Mu" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>

    <p>Finally, an alert (shown below) will appear. To actually launch Mu click
    on the "Open" button.</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/osx_beta3.png" alt="Click Open" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>
    <p><strong>These steps can take some time as OSX checks the Mu package, but
    you'll only ever have to do them once.</strong></p>
