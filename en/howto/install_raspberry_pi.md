# How to install Mu on a Raspberry Pi

If you're using the Raspberry Pi Foundation's official

operating system you should use your preferred package management application
and install `mu-editor`.

If you're familiar with a terminal it's as simple as typing:

```
apt-get install mu-editor
```

Mu should be accessible from the desktop's menu.
