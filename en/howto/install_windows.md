# How to install Mu on Windows with the Official Installer 

Since most of our users will be using Mu on Windows in an educational setting
we've made it extraordinarily easy to install Mu on Windows. We've checked
Mu works on Windows 7 (32bit) and Windows 10 (64bit) - so it should work on
all the versions of Windows in between.

First, follow the
[advice on Microsoft's website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq) to work out if you're using 32 or 64 bit Windows.

Next, [download the correct installer](/en/download) for your version of
Windows (either 32 or 64 bit for Windows 7 or above). The installer itself is
an executable so you need to run it to make it work.

Follow the steps illustrated below and, once installation has finished, you'll
find Mu in your start menu.
