Mu works on Window 7, 8 and 10 in 32 bit and 64 bit. Its a good idea to make sure your system to up-to-date with all Windows updates.

If you in an educational setting you may need to get your system administrator to run the installer for you.

## Step 1 - Download Mu Installer

[Download](/en/download) the correct 32 bit or 64 bit installer for your operating system.

To find out whether you need a 32 bit or 64 bit installer:

  <br/>
</div>

There is also [advice on Microsoft's website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq) for finding whether you are using 32 or 64 bit Windows.

# Step 2 - Run the installer

+ Find the installer you just downloaded (it's probably in your Downloads folder)

<div class="row">
  <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/win7.1.png" alt="Windows 7 - Find the installer" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/>
  <br/>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/win10.1.png" alt="Windows 10 -Find the installer" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/>
  <br/>
</div>

+ Double-click the installer to run it.

<div class="panel panel-warning">
    <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!</h3></div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    <p>Mu is in the closing stages of a final 1.0 release. As a result it is
    still considered BETA software and this reflects how the installer
    currently works.</p>
    
    <p>Put simply, we currently don't sign the installer so
    Windows complains about Mu coming from an unknown publisher. When the Mu
    1.0 is finally released the installer won't have this issue.</p>

    <p>In any case, we've outlined the extra steps needed to help Windows
    install Mu for both Windows 7 and Windows 10 (other versions of Windows
    will be similar).</p>

    <h3>Windows 7</h3>
    <p>"User Account Control" will ask you if you want to allow this program to make changes to your computer.
    Click "Yes"</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/win7.2.png" alt="Click Yes" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>
    <h3>Windows 10</h3>
    <p>Windows Defender will pop up with a warning message. You should click on the "More info" link.</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/win10.2_annotated.png" alt="Click More Info" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>
    <p>The message will change giving you more information about the installer and display a "Run anyway" button. Click
    "Run anyway".</p>
    <img src="/img/en/howto/beta/win10.3.png" alt="Click Run Anyway" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/><br/>
    </div>
</div>

## Step 3 - Start the install
